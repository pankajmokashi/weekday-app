### Steps to run React application

- Install Node.js
- Clone the Repository:
    - Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    - Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository locally.
        - git clone https://github.com/pankajmokashi/weather-app.git

- Navigate to the Project Directory:
    - Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory using the cd command.
      	- cd weather-app

- Install Dependencies:
    - React projects typically use npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:
      	- npm install
      	- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
      	- npm i react-infinite-scroll-component
        - npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk

- Run the Development Server:
    - After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the npm start command:
      	- npm start
